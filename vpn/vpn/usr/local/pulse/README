1) What are the pre-requisites to run the command line client?
-	PCS IP address or hostname
- 	VPN user name and password
- 	PCS sign-in URL
-	Proxy details like IP address/hostname, proxy username and password (If the client proxy is used)
- 	Realm

2) How to launch the command line client?
-	The command line client can be launched using the command below :
	For 32 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient.sh -h <PCS appliance IP/hostname> -u <vpn username> -p <vpn password> -U <PCS SIGNINURL>  -r <realm>
													or
	For 64 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient_x86_64.sh -h <PCS appliance IP/hostname> -u <vpn username> -p <vpn password> -U <PCS SIGNINURL>  -r <realm>

	eg:
	/usr/local/pulse/PulseClient.sh -h 10.209.118.244 -u user1 -p PulseSecure -U https://10.209.118.244 -r mobileusers 

Note:
- 	The PulseClient.sh / PulseClient_x86_64.sh arguments are stored internally and these arguments will be reused later, if no arguments are provided. 
	Arguments storage will be overwritten if new set of arguments are provided to the script.

- 	Following command can be used to know the usage of the various options of the command line client.
	For 32 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient.sh -H
	For 64 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient_x86_64.sh -H

- 	In case the user doesn't want the password to be revealed, he can choose not to provide the password as a command line parameter. A prompt will be prompted to 	read the password.

-   The script will install the dependent packages (glibc, zlib, nss) if these packages are not already installed. 

- "-f" option is deprecated. CA certificate store is used to verify the PCS certificate. 
    In RHEL/CentOS/Fedora, "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt" is used as CA certificate store.
    In Ubuntu, "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt" is used to as CA certificate store. 

3) How to launch the command line client with proxy?
-	The command line client with proxy can be launched using the command below :
	For 32 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient.sh -h <PCS appliance IP/hostname> -u <vpn username> -p <vpn password> -U <PCS SIGNINURL> -y <proxy IP/hostname> -z <proxy port> -s <proxy username> -a <proxy password> 
														or	
	For 64 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient_x86_64.sh -h <PCS appliance IP/hostname> -u <vpn username> -p <vpn password> -U <PCS SIGNINURL> -y <proxy IP/hostname> -z <proxy port> -s <proxy username> -a <proxy password> 
Note:
- 	In case the user doesn't want to reveal the proxy password in the command line arguments, he can pass -I parameter instead of the proxy password parameter i.e -a.
	Then a prompt will be given to take the proxy password.

4) How to check the status of the VPN connection? 
-	The status of the VPN connection can be seen by giving the following command.
	For 32 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient.sh -S
							or
	For 64 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient_x86_64.sh -S
Note: 
-   This command could take upto 10s to reflect the current state of the Pulse client. 
	
5) How to terminate the command line client?
- 	The command line client can be terminated using the following command.
	For 32 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient.sh -K
							or
	For 64 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient_x86_64.sh -K

6) How to upload the pulse service logs into PCS server?
- The command line client can be launch to upload the logs with below command
   For 32 bit client:  /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient.sh -h <PCS appliance IP/hostname> -u <vpn username> -p <vpn password> -g
													or
   For 64 bit client:  /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient_x86_64.sh -h <PCS appliance IP/hostname> -u <vpn username> -p <vpn password> -g

Note: 
- This command connects to PCS server and uploads the log into the server.

7) How to launch Pulse secure Linux UI:
    Launch UI from the applications:
        1) The UI launcher is installed in the applications tab.
        2) The user has to go to applications and search for the "pulse secure" UI and launch it by clicking the icon.
    
    Launch UI from the terminal:
        1) Append /usr/local/pulse to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
            example: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/pulse
        
        3) Launch the UI by executing the below command 
            /usr/local/pulse/pulseUi

8) How to install the dependency packages to run the UI?
- The dependency packages for UI can be installed using the below command:
   For 32 bit client:  /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient.sh install_dependency_packages
				or
   For 64 bit client:  /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient_x86_64.sh install_dependency_packages

9) How to install, remove and list client certificates
       Below are commands to install, delete and list the client certificates using PulseClient.sh
       These commands are only needed if the client certificate authentication is enabled ie PCS
       needs end user client certificate for authentication.

       For 32 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient.sh install_certificates 
                                       [-inpfx < PFX file > ]
                                       [-inpriv <private file> -inpub <public file>]
       			 		  /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient.sh list_installed_certificates
											or
       For 64 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient_x86_64.sh install_certificates 
                                       [-inpfx < PFX file > ]
                                       [-inpriv <private file> -inpub <public file>]
       			 		  /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient_x86_64.sh list_installed_certificates

       Please use the list command to get the certName for delete.
       For 32 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient.sh delete_certificates -certName <Certificate Name>
														OR
       For 64 bit client: /usr/local/pulse/PulseClient_x86_64.sh delete_certificates -certName <Certificate Name>
